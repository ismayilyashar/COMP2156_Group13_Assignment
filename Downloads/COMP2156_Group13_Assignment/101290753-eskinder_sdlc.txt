# DevOps incorporates security practices into the software development lifecycle, a concept known as DevSecOps. By learning DevOps engineering, professionals can understand how to integrate security controls and compliance measures into the development and deployment processes, thereby reducing security risks and vulnerabilities in software applications. Another critical aspect of DevOps engineering is the focus on feedback loops and continuous improvement. DevOps encourages a culture of learning from failures and using feedback to drive iterative enhancements to software systems. By learning DevOps principles, individuals can develop skills in measuring key performance indicators, conducting post-release evaluations, and implementing improvements based on user feedback and operational insights. This iterative approach to development and operations leads to more resilient and customer-centric software products
