# While nearly 75% of all businesses use some form of DevOps today, the concept of DevOps originated around 2007. At the time, software developers and IT operators questioned the traditional software development model. Under that model, developers wrote the initial code for a software program but worked independently from the operations team, who later maintained and supported the code throughout the softwareâ€™s lifespan. DevOps was an effort to combine the development and operations teams and workflows into one.
